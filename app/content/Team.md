> "The only thing that motivates this team is hatred, money, and food." -Ryan Taylor

Over the course of the summer, all of us at Virginia iGEM have gone from complete strangers to good friends. Contrary to the words of our team captain, we're also motivated by friendship, mandatory team bonding activities and good humor. Partially. 

We couldn't have done everything we did without the fantastic contributions and hard work of everyone on the team. Whether it was through Wetlab, Human Practices, Modeling, or Wiki, it was all vital to the success of our project. We became better friends on the team and made a lot of good memories outside of lab through beach volleyball, potlucks, playing Super Smash Bros, and rock climbing. 

We are the twelve undergraduates of Virginia iGEM and here is our team!

## Advisors

**Keith Kozminski** is our amazing advisor who helps guide our research and keeps us on track for the iGEM Jamboree. From teaching a prepatory iGEM course in the spring to helping us with various aspects of our project, Professor Kozminski's wise words and advice has warmed our hearts.

**Jason Papin** is the modeling advisor for our team. With his help and advice, we have developed several models that have significantly shaped our project. We are thankful for all the advice and encouragement that Professor Papin has given us throughout our research! (_Photo taken from UVA Today_)

			<p>Dylan is a third year studying engineering science. In addition to being devastatingly handsome, he is a wearer of many hats on our team, being a part of the Modeling, Wiki, and Human Practices committees _in addition to_ our graphics designer and co-CFO. His main project was the Wiki, including the gorgeous styling, rugged backend tools that make it work, interactive components and the inspired graphic design seen throughout the project.</p>

			<p>Will is a second year who is majoring in biology and minoring in biochemistry. He is a part of Wetlab and Human Practices and his quirky personality helps to brighten up the lab. He puts his all into the lab, riding the roller coaster of successes and setbacks and ultimately being one of the hardest working members of the Wetlab team.</p>
