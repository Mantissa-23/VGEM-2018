## Postcard Exchange

We participated in this year's postcard exchange by [Düesseldorf](http://2018.igem.org/Team:Duesseldorf)! Here's the postcard that we created:

This year, Team Düsseldorf held a postcard exchange event for iGEM teams in order to promote synthetic biology in public using postcards designed by different iGEM teams. Each participating team designs their own postcard and exchanges it with other participating teams so every team can collect postcards from all over the world. 

This year, we participated in the event and did the postcard exchange with 50 other participating schools. The word cloud on our postcard was generated from project descriptions scraped from all the 2018 iGEM wiki pages, and the shape of it is the UVA Rotunda, the spiritual symbol of Thomas Jefferson’s University. 


## Summer Camp

We went to the Kids College summer camp held at Charlottesville Albemarle Technical Education Center (CATEC) “Manipulating Life Itself & Human Cyborg” in collaboration with Charlottesville Open Bio Lab. The students of the summer camp was aged between 12 to 16.

We helped them run the gels, understand the gel, talked about our project, and helped them brainstorm about what kind of world problem they could solve with synthetic biology. The students came up with many interesting project ideas related to synthetic biology, it was definitely a huge success for letting students in the community explore the field of synthetic biology. 


## Public Forum

We are planning a public forum on the public perception of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO). _More details to come._
