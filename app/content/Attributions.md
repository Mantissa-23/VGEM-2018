**William E. Bentley** is a professor in the Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering department at the University of Maryland and the Distinguished Professor and Chair of the Fischell Department of Bioengineering. Since much of his research focuses on the expression of biologically active proteins and quorum sensing, we have referenced many of his papers within the context of our research.

**Steven Graff's** paper, _"A Mathematical Model to Study the Role of the Lsr Intergenic Region in Mediation of Autoinducer-2 Quorum Sensing in_ Escherichia Coli" has been an important reference for our project. After we reached out to him, Steven Graff graciously allowed us to use his models and data and has given us invaluable advice for our modeling our project.
