**William E. Bentley** is a professor in the Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering department at the University of Maryland and the Distinguished Professor and Chair of the Fischell Department of Bioengineering. Since his research focuses on the expression of biologically active proteins, we have referenced many of his papers within the context of our research.

**Shaun Moshasha** is the executive director of [Open Bio Labs](https://www.facebook.com/openbiolabs/) in Charlottesville, VA. He is also the Chief Executive Officer at [Kombucha Biomaterials LLC](/Public_Engagement.html). He has been a huge help in guiding our project and has been helping plan our forum this upcoming fall.

**Steven Graff's** paper, _"A Mathematical Model to Study the Role of the Lsr Intergenic Region in Mediation of Autoinducer-2 Quorum Sensing in_ Escherichia Coli" has been an important reference with regards to our project. After reaching out, Steven Graff has graciously allowed us to use his models and data and given us invaluable advice for our project.

**Amin Zargar's** paper, _"Enhancing Intercellular Coordination: Rewiring Quorum Sensing Networks for Increased Protein Expression through Autonomous Induction"_ significantly helped us guide our project. We were fortunate enough to be able to contact him through Skype and ask him for advice on various aspects of our project.
