Over the spring, summer, and fall, we have had tremendous help from a number of generous individuals. Thank you so much to everyone. We can’t express our gratitude for all the help, guidance, and support you’ve given us.

# Researchers and Experts 

The Virginia IGEM team would not be where it is today without the tremendous help of several brilliant minds. Thank you to all of them.   

## William E. Bentley and Kristina Stephens, Researcher in the Bentley Lab

</figure>

William E. Bentley is the Distinguished Professor and Chair of the Fischell Department of Bioengineering and a professor in the Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering department at the University of Maryland. Since much of his research focuses on the expression of biologically active proteins and quorum sensing, we have referenced many of his papers within the context of our research. We have also requested and received W3110 _E. coli_ from his lab. 

We would like to thank the lab of Dr. Bentley and specifically our point of contact, Kristina Stephens, at UMD for sending several plasmids and cell lines that Amin Zargar used in his research. It was important to have these parts because we were able to validate Zargar’s research and test our parts in his chassis also.

## Paul Humphreys 

Paul Humphreys is a Commonwealth Professor of Philosophy of Science at UVA. Professor Humphreys gave us advice on how to connect quorum sensing to our human practices. He provided us a philosophical perspective to our research and really made us dive into the ethics of synthetic biology. Talking to him early in the summer help us shape our integrated human practices and helped us created our video about quorum sensing.

 Shaun Moshasha is the Executive Director of [Open Bio Labs](http://openbiolabs.org/) in Charlottesville, VA. Sean helped the human practices committee extensively. As an alumnus of Virginia iGEM, he was a great resource to ask about various iGEM related procedures. 

 He helped design our GMO forum and let us help him teach middle and high schoolers about synthetic biology at CATEC. We also had a great time making paper at Open Biolabs from bacterial cellulose. He helped us write our financial analysis report which was key to highlight the importance of our project.

## Madison Telles

Madison Telles is our Commissioned Illustrator! Thank you to Madison Telles for helping us in the last few weeks of the project. She is a digital artist who specializes in character design, and we commissioned her to work on the banners seen at the head of every major section of our Wiki; her illustrations added a bit of flair to the Wiki that was missing before.

Kay Christopher is a Preparator for Upper Levels in the UVA Biology Department. Ms. Christopher is one the few people that saw our hard work everyday. She maintained our lab daily. All orders went through her. She taught us basic lab safety and several neat tricks in lab. She was always there to answer any questions we had. Gilmer 148, our lab, wouldn’t have been the well maintained and constructive workspace it was if weren’t for her hard work and supervision. 

## Keith Kozminski

Keith Kozminski is the Associate Professor of Biology and Cell Biology at UVA. Professor Kozminski is the primary advisor for Virginia iGEM, and he has a special place in our hearts. He guided our research from beginning to end. He answered our endless questions and kept us on track. When he wasn’t in the building, he was only a phone call away.  He taught us many of the lab techniques we know today. He fought for our funding endlessly. We could go on and on about Professor Kozminski’s contribution to the team, but that would need its own Wiki page. 

We would like to sincerely thank him for his dedication to the team.
