**William E. Bentley** is a professor in the Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering department at the University of Maryland and the Distinguished Professor and Chair of the Fischell Department of Bioengineering. Since much of his research focuses on the expression of biologically active proteins and quorum sensing, we have referenced many of his papers within the context of our research.

**Drew Endy** is a prominent figure in the synthetic biology community and the professor of bioengineering at Stanford University in California. We are thankful for his help in shipping us a plasmid for our project.

**Steven Graff's** paper, _"A Mathematical Model to Study the Role of the Lsr Intergenic Region in Mediation of Autoinducer-2 Quorum Sensing in_ Escherichia Coli" has been an important reference for our project. After we reached out to him, Steven Graff graciously allowed us to use his models and data and has given us invaluable advice for our modeling our project.

**Dr. Sara Hooshangi** is an associate professor at George Washington University. Her paper, "LsrR Quorum Sensing 'Switch' Is Revealed by a Bottom-Up Approach" has been notable reference for modeling our system.

**Shaun Moshasha** is the executive director of [Open Bio Labs](https://www.facebook.com/openbiolabs/) in Charlottesville, VA. He is also the Chief Executive Officer at [Kombucha Biomaterials LLC](/Public_Engagement.html). He has been a huge help in guiding our project and has been helping plan our forum this upcoming fall.

**Amin Zargar's** paper, _"Enhancing Intercellular Coordination: Rewiring Quorum Sensing Networks for Increased Protein Expression through Autonomous Induction"_ significantly helped us guide our project. We were fortunate enough to be able to contact him through Skype and ask him for advice on various aspects of our project.
