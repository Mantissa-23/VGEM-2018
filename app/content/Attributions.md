## Advisors

**Amin Zargar's** paper, _"Enhancing Intercellular Coordination: Rewiring Quorum Sensing Networks for Increased Protein Expression through Autonomous Induction"_ has been an invaluable resource for our project. We were fortunate enough to be able to contact Zargar through Skype and ask him for various advice on our project.

**Shaun Moshasha** is the executive director of [Open Bio Labs](https://www.facebook.com/openbiolabs/) in Charlottesville, VA.

**Steven Graff's** paper, _"A Mathematical Model to Study the Role of the Lsr Intergenic Region in Mediation of Autoinducer-2 Quorum Sensing in_ Escherichia Coli" has helped significantly shape our project. Additionally, we have reached out to him for advice on our project and he has given us his models and data for use.

**William E. Bentley** is a professor in the Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering department at the University of Maryland.
