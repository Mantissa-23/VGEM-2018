# Human Practices

## Paper Making

Since an important part of our project is focused on biomanufacturing, we teamed up with Kombucha Biomaterials, LLC. Their company focuses on using alternative, robust materials and methods that are sustainible and cost effective to make cellulose from kombucha to make paper. 

We sat in on a paper making session and learned all the steps. Here's our team in paper-making action:
