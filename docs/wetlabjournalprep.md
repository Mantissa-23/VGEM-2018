# WetlabJournalPrep

You should probably write a bash script that does the following:
- Translates WetlabJournal.html into WetlabJournal.hbs, pulling out the `<body>` and `<head>` tags and places them in the `/app/partials` directory. Entirely expunge Google Docs styles.
  - Replace `<body>` tag with `<div class="labjournal Cxx Cyy">`
  - Remove the metadata tag from `<head>`; all we want is the styles
- Moves images to `/app/images/LabJournal/`, overwriting any old stuff.
- Corrects image paths by changing `src="images/imagex.{png,jpg}"` to `src="images/LabJournal/imagex.{png,jpg}"`
  - Use regex `s/src="images/src="\/images\/LabJournal/g`
- Disables use of custom fonts?? Not sure if we should do this or not, it's optional
  - Use regex `s/font-family\(.*\)$/\/\*font-family\1*\//g`
- Makes styling specific to the lab by adding the `.labjournal` class as a parent of all the wetlab styling generated by Google Docs
  - Use regex `s/^ *\(.*{\)$/.labjournal \1`
- Bump all tables to the right instead of to the left by changing from negative left margins to positive
  - Use regex `s/margin-left: -/margin-left: /g`
- Remove the template and unnecessary metainstructions the wetlab team uses at the top of the markup
  - Need to write a regex for this once

All the partials templates are where they should belong. If you don't make a BASH script this all needs to be redone before the wiki freeze.
